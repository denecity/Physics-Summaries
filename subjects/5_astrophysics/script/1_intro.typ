== Units

=== Solar Mass $M_(o)$

$1 M_(o) = 1.989 times 10^30 "kg"$.

=== Astronomical Unit $A u$

$1 A u = 1.496 times 10^11 "m"$.

=== Parsec $p c$

$1 p c = 3.086 times 10^16 "m"$.

Defined as the distance to an object that has a parallax of 1 arcsecond. $Theta approx (1 A u)/d$.

Sun $<=>$ Proxima Centauri $1.3$ $p c$.

== Coordinate Systems

=== Equatorial Coordinates

Defined with right ascention $alpha$ (along the equatorial plane) and declination $delta$ (angle from the equatorial plane). The zero point is defined as the intersect between the equatorial plane and solar system equator.

=== Galactic Coordinates

Sun as the origin. Galactic plane defines Longitude $l$ and normal Latitude $b$. $l = 0$ is the direction of the galactic center.

== Magnitudes

=== Luminosity

$L approx (e r g)/s$, where $e r g$ is energy.

=== Flux

Flux is energy per unit surface per unit time. $F approx (e r g)/(s c m^2)$. It is dependent on the observer. $F = L/(4 pi d^2)$.

=== Apparent Magnitude

$
  m_1 - m_2 = 2.5 log_10(F_1/F_2)\
  => F_1/F_2 = 10^((m_1 - m_2)/2.5)\
$

=== Wavelength Dependence and Band Response

Many telescopes have the UBV dependence.
